Description: Compared to their deterministic brethren, stochastic differential equations require novel tools to describe the stability of their equilibria.  One tool is the quasi-potential, computed using the ordered-upwind method, which is implemented in the QPot package.  QPot also includes a collection of tools to simulate and visualize the results of stochastic differential equations.
