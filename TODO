set up configure figure for windows


Ccode
----------------------------------------
confirm that abort or exit is not used.
check to make sure long type isn't used.
should not write to stdout or stderr
do not call C rand, but use R rand
run "nm -pg mypkg.so" and look for unsatisfied entry points(?) check "if any of the symbols marked U is unexpected."
maybe change variable names
"It is not portable to call compiled code in R or other packages via .Internal, .C, .Fortran, .Call or .External, since such interfaces are subject to change without notice and will probably result in your code terminating the R process. " Then how do you call them?

General 
---------------------------------------
Do not use paste in error statements in R
